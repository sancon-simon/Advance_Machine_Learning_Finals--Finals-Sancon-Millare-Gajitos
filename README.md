Pandas for Data Manipulation and analysis, Seaborn for Statistical data visualization based on matplotlib, Matplotlib for Plotting and visualization, Scikit-learn for Machine learning, including model selection, training, and evaluation, along with preprocessing utilities, and Statsmodel for Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, particularly for time series analysis.

1. **Pandas -** This library is for data manipulation and analysis. It offer tools and structures for managing numerical tables and time series, making it perfect for analyzing and processing large datasets like the Addidas Sales Analysis.
2. **Seaborn -** This library is for statistical data visualization, based on Matplotlib, that simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations, such as heatmaps, time series plots, and categorical plots, by providing high-level functions and built-in themes and color palettes. This makes it useful for exploring and understanding data patterns and relationships.
3. **Matplotlib -** This library is for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It offers plotting functions for generating various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and more. This is used in scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization tasks due to its flexibility and extensive capabilities.
4. **Scikit-learn  -** This library is for machine learning. It offers various machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more. Also, this includes utilities for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model selection.
5. **Statsmodel   -** This library is for estimating and interpreting statistical models. It provides a wide range of tools for conducting statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and econometric modeling. It also offers functionality for exploring data, conducting statistical tests, and visualizing results.

**Data Loading and Preprocessing**

•	**Data Loading:** Loading data from a CSV file into python involves libraries such as pandas or Python's built-in csv module. Using import pandas as pd and then use the pd.read_csv() function for it to read the CSV file into a pandas as a DataFrame, enabling data manipulation operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregation, and visualization.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

•	**Handling Dates -** The "Invoice Date" column in our Dataset was converted to datetime format using ‘pd.to_datetime()’, and then set as the index for time series analysis.
•	**Handling Missing Values -** Missing values were identified using ‘isnull()’ and the count of missing values was obtained using ‘sum()’. A heatmap visualization ‘sns.heatmap()’ was created to visualize the missing data pattern.
•	**Descriptive Statistics** - Descriptive statistics of the dataset were generated using ‘describe()’ to gain insights into the data distribution and identify potential outliers.
•	**Categorical Data** - Categorical variables like "Region", "Product Category", "Sales Method", and "Gender Type" were analyzed using value counts (‘value_counts()’) and visualized using bar plots (‘plt.bar()’ or ‘sns.countplot()’) to understand the distribution and trends within each category.
•	**Data Transformation** - For machine learning implementation, data was prepared by dropping irrelevant columns ("Retailer ID", "State", "City"), creating a binary target variable ("High_Sales") based on a threshold, and generating dummy variables for categorical features using ‘pd.get_dummies()’.
•	**Standardization** - Data standardization was performed using ‘StandardScaler()’ to scale numerical features before training the logistic regression model.
The structure for any Python-based data analysis workflow is laid by these steps, providing a structured approach to comprehend and visualize user data. This is to ensure the dataset's structure, completeness, and compatibility with analysis and modeling techniques, thereby ensuring its readiness for advanced analysis and visualizations.


## III. Data Analysis Techniques

Outline the various data analysis techniques used in the project, such as:

**Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistic such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values used to understand the distribution of data. These statistics provide a concise overview of the central tendency, variability, and shape of the dataset, facilitating a better understanding of its characteristics and informing subsequent analyses and decision-making processes. Here Here’s how they help in the context of Adidas Sales Analysis: 

•	**Mean -** The mean provides the average sales value, helping to gauge the overall performance of Adidas products across different regions, product categories, or sales methods. It offers a central reference point for assessing sales trends and identifying areas of strength or weakness.
•	**Median -**  The median represents the middle value of the sales data when arranged in ascending order. It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean and provides a robust measure of central tendency. The median helps to understand the typical or typical sales performance, especially in datasets with outliner.
•	**Standard Deviation -** The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of sales values around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in sales, which can highlight regions, product categories, or sales methods with inconsistent performance. This helps in assessing the reliability and predictability of sales data.
•	**Minimum and Maximum Values -** The minimum and maximum sales values indicate the lowest and highest recorded sales figures, respectively. They provide insights into the range of sales performance observed in the dataset. Identifying the minimum and maximum values helps in understanding the breadth of sales data and identifying outliers or exceptionally high-performing regions, products, or sales methods.
