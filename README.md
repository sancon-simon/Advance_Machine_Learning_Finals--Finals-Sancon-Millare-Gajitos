## VI. Machine Learning Implementation

**Logistic Regression Model**

(Discuss the data preparation, Data Selection, Data Cleaning and Feature Scaling implementation. Process of building the machine learning model. Including the training and testing sets.) Logistic Regression's is a widely used statistical method for binary classification problems. For our analysis of predicting high sales in the Adidas dataset, logistic regression is a perfect fit because of its interpretability, computing efficiency, robustness, and suitability for binary classification.

**Preparing the Data for Logistic Regression**

**Data Selection and Data Cleaning -** To effectively prepare the data for analysis, we first inspect the dataset's shape, column names, and data types. We identify and count missing values, then visualize the missing data pattern to guide our cleaning strategy.

We clean the data by removing irrelevant columns such as "Retailer ID", "State", and "City". These columns are not directly relevant to our analysis of sales performance. Next, we create a new binary target variable, High_Sales, based on the median of Total Sales. Sales values above the median are labeled as 1 (high sales), and those below or equal to the median are labeled as 0.

For categorical variables such as "Gender Type", "Region", "Product Category", and "Sales Method", we use one-hot encoding to convert these categories into numerical values. This transformation is essential for the Logistic Regression model, as it cannot handle categorical data directly.

**Feature Scaling -** Feature scaling is necessary to standardize the values of the features. We split the dataset into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split. Standardization ensures that all feature values are on a similar scale, which is important for the Logistic Regression model's effectiveness. We apply standard scaling to the training set and use the same scaling parameters to transform the testing set.

**Building the Logistic Regression Model**

**Model Training**

•	**Splitting Data -** After data preparation, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set, comprising 70% of the data, is used to train the model, while the testing set, containing the remaining 30%, is reserved for evaluation.

•	**Model Fitting -** With the training set prepared, we fit the Logistic Regression model to the data. During this process, the model learns the relationship between the predictor variables (features) and the binary target variable (high sales). This involves estimating the coefficients of the model that best describe the relationship.

**Model Evaluation:**

•	**Performance Metrics -** After the model is trained, we evaluate its performance using various metrics. These metrics include accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted outcomes, and a confusion matrix, which provides a breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions. Also, a detailed classification report offers insights into the model's precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

•	**Residual Analysis -** Residual analysis involves examining the discrepancies between the predicted and actual values. By analyzing the residuals, we can identify any patterns or trends that the model may have missed. This analysis helps us assess the model's overall fit and identify areas for improvement.
